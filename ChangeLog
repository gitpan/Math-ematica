	* ematica.pm: Solaris nroff seems to hav eproblems with the output
	generated for '=item C<something>'.

	* Makefile.PL: Added MAN3PODS to WriteMakefile call.  Newer
	versions of Perl would not generate manual pages without that.

	* Added ppport.h for compatibility with newer Perls.  Verified
	that the module works with Mathematica 4.0 for Solaris.
