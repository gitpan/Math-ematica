This is nearly the same as Math-Mathematica-1.0.5.tar.gz. I just
changed the name and version numbering when checking with perl-5.002.
It also runs with perl5.001n (MakeMaker  5.00). 

NAME
       Math::ematica - Communicate to Mathematica via MathLink

SYNOPSIS
       use Math::ematica;

       $link = new Math::ematica( MathLink args )

DESCRIPTION
       This is a very basic interface to the MathLink library of
       Mathematica. Mathematica is registered trademark of
       Wolfram Research, Inc. I use version 2.2. There are tree
       groups of functions.

INSTALLATION:

        Edit Makefile.PL. Customize the variables MATHLIBDIR and
        MATHINCDIR to match your local settings.

        Before running the test you should also customize MATHPROGRAM,
        MATHHOST, and MATHPORT. Details are in the comments there.

        Then proceed as usual:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install
